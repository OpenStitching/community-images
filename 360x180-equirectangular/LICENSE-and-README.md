# Copyright Notice

These photos were taken by [Sybren St√ºvel](https://stuvelfoto.nl/), November 2023, in Erawan, Thailand.

The photos are offered for use in the [OpenStitching project](https://github.com/OpenStitching/stitching) to aid in the development of support for spherical panoramas. The photos can be copied and modified for this purpose, as long as this notice is kept with the files.

## History of these files

The photos were taken with a Fuji X-S10 camera, with its 18-55mm kitlens at 18mm. A Nodal Ninja 3 on a tripod was used to position the camera. 38 camera orientations were used: 3 rows of 12 photos, zenith, and nadir. Each position was used to make 5 photos using exposure bracketing. These exposures were merged using [Brakketor](https://gitlab.com/dr.sybren/brakketor) and [enblend](https://enblend.sourceforge.net/) into the 38 JPEG files you find here.
