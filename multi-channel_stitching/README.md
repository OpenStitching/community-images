Two test files are provided which both contain 3D numpy arrays. The first two coordinates are spatial, the third coordinate contains different channels of which 4 are included in the files.

The data is offered for use in the OpenCV project to aid the development of multi-channel stitching. It may be copied and modified for this purpose, only.
